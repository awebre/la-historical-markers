    <p>
      LA Historical Markers (also known as LAHM) does not collect any
      information about you or your devices, does not seek to associate any
      information that is collected with any individual end user, and only
      requests access to those device permissions which are strictly necessary
      for the app to function. Where possible, LAHM offers users with options to
      contribute to the crowd-sourcing of marker details without requiring
      potentially invasive permissions such as fine location data or camera
      access.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The use of location data within LAHM is restricted to functionality
      related to discovery and authorship of markers. Your location may be used
      to search for nearby markers, calculate distances between markers, and to
      pinpoint the location of a new marker that you are authoring. In cases
      where location data is used for search or distance calculations, this data
      <b class="font-bold">is not</b> associated with any device or user
      information and <b class="font-bold">is not</b> stored or cached. In cases
      where location data is used as part of the submission of a new marker,
      this data <b class="font-bold">will be stored</b>, though it is not
      associated with any device or user information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      LAHM does store user-entered data, which is subject to a review and
      moderation process. User entered data includes the titles, descriptions,
      images and coordinates of signs submitted through the app. This
      information is submitted with complete anonymity - no device or user
      information is stored alongside this user-entered content.
    </p>
